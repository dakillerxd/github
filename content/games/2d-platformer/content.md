## Overview

"2D Platformer" started as a small project to learn and expand skills but ballooned into its own game. It features fluid movement mechanics including wall-jumping and dashing, complemented by forgiving systems like coyote time and jump buffering. Players navigate through meticulously crafted levels filled with interactive elements such as soft platforms, crumbling surfaces, and portals, all supported by fine-tuned physics and camera systems.

## Core Design Elements

### Player Abilities

- Double jump, wall sliding, wall jump, and dashing mechanics provide a versatile and engaging platforming experience.
- Coyote jump and jump buffering techniques create a more forgiving and responsive control scheme.
- Variable jump height allows players to control their jump trajectory and navigate the environment with precision.

### Environmental Elements

- Hazardous obstacles like lava and spikes that make traversal dangerous.-Â Soft objects that players can jump through from below but land on from above.
- Crumbling objects that add a sense of urgency and require quick decision-making.
- Moving platforms that require timing and coordination to navigate.
- Portals that transport players to different parts of the level or to entirely new areas.
- Checkpoints that allow players to save their progress and provide a sense of accomplishment.

### Level Design and Progression

- Carefully crafted levels that gradually introduce new mechanics and challenges.
- Fake walls and hidden areas that reward exploration and encourage players to search for secrets.
- Balanced difficulty curve that keeps players engaged and motivated to improve their skills.

### Camera

- Camera smoothly follows the player's movement and adjusts based on their position and velocity.
- Intelligent camera positioning ensures optimal visibility of the player's surroundings.
- Smooth camera transitions between different areas of the level create a seamless gameplay experience.
