## Core Design Elements
### Combat System
- Melee attacks, special abilities (dashing, AOE attack), and a ranged fireball spell create a varied combat experience.
- Stamina system requires resource management and strategic decision-making during battles.
### Resource Management
- Health, stamina, and mana management system challenges players to balance their resources effectively.
- Healing options, such as consumable potions and rest points, provide players with strategic choices during combat.
### Enemy Design
- Diverse monster roster with unique behaviors and abilities, such as inflicting status effects (poison, fire damage), creates varied challenges.
- Boss battles featuring distinct combat patterns test players' skills and adaptability.
